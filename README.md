# LearningFrameworks

Students will use this starter code to learn how frameworks like Bootstrap use a grid system (collumns and rows) to position and size elements on a web page.

Bootstrap splits every full width row into 12 columns.  This allows developers to easily make widths of one forth, one third, one half, two thirds, three fourths and so on because 12 is the least common denominator of all of those fractions.

## Instructions
1. Clone or Download the starter files to your local machine. (Extract if necessary)
2. Open the ```/LearningFrameworks``` directory in a text editor.
3. Read through the ```index.html``` and the ```learningFrameworks.css``` files.
  * Notice that the ```<link>``` to the ```learningFrameworks.css``` is not in the ```<head>```
  * Notice that none of the ```<div>```s have appropriate classes assigned to them.
4. Fix the ```<link>``` to the style sheet.
5. Start to add the appropriate classes to each of the ```<div>```s.  Remember that each row is full width (12 columns).
6. Note that at this point the ```learningFrameworks.css``` file has not defined all of the different widths for our page. You need to define the rules for the remaing classes.
7. In the stylesheet add a different background color to each of the classes so that their widths are more noticeable.
8. Extra Credit - Make each of the sections have a border.  The catch is that you need to ensure that the border does not cause the div to jump to the next row.
